    "## Challenges\n",
    "#### The problem of thresholding\n",
    "In order to assess the similarity between a new expression and previously observed expressions, one of the main challenges is choosing the right similarity threshold below which any candidate pair of expressions are considered dissimilar and can therefore be reliably discarded as a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the problem lies in the fact that potentially many pairs of expressions will be similar based on some of the features used by the system to measure the similarity. This means that a simple heuristic such as picking always the highest-scoring match, will usually result in all correct matches being selected but also in many incorrect matches being selected as well (since there is always a highest-scoring match, even when the actual score is not objectively high). That is, given that the similarity scale expresses relative similarity rather than absolute similarity, we need some other way for the system to be able to detect __true negatives__ with some degree of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "In section ###, we will discuss in detail the implementation of a solution for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The problem of partial matches\n",
    "Another issue, closely related to the problem of thresholding introduced in the previous point, is the fact that the system may miss a legitimate match between two answers due to the match existing between some of the answers' subunits rather than the full answers themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, in order to measure the similarity between a pair of answers, the system needs to take into account some ratio of the number of features that they share with respect to their total number of features (by using e.g. the Euclidean distance or some similar metric). By definition, partial matches contain all the information relevant for triggering a match, plus some amount of irrelevant information that should not trigger it. In case that the features activated by the irrelevant information outweight the features activated by the relevant information, the similarity between the two may fall below the chosen threshold, resulting in a __false negative__. \n",
    "\n",
    "Details on a potential solution for this problem are given in section ###.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The problem of linguistic variation\n",
    "Ultimately, linguistic variation is the key linguistic challenge underlying both tasks. That is, given that natural languages allow the same thought to be expressed in a number of different ways, any similarity metric aimed at measuring the semantic relatedness between two expressions must ideally provide robustness across all, or as many of their variants as possible, for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of robustness is determined by the choice of features, which must be consistent and must remain the same across variants of the same idea, i.e., feature extraction must be performed in such a way that the features extracted from two variants expressing the same overall meaning, must reflect none of the linguistic variations making the original expressions different.\n",

    "Although both character n-grams and stemming algorithms provide a comparable boost in recall, the former are simpler overall, on the one hand, and the latter, on the other hand, do not provide a significant improvement in precision, which is why character n-grams were chosen as features in our system.\n",

    "* By using character n-grams, many legitimate linguistic variants of the same lemma that would not have been matched otherwise, will now be matched through their component parts. That is, character n-grams play the same role in feature extraction as features do in classification: in a classification task, we want to reduce two instances to their respective sets of features and we then expect the latter to intersect if the two instances are similar in any relevant way. When using character n-grams, words are also reduced to their respective sets of \"features\" (character sequences), which we then expect to intersect if the two words are variants of the same word and, therefore, share the root or some other majority subset of their characters.\n",
    "\n",

However, the performance of this model was rather poor overall. After performing the error analysis, some trivial issues became apparent that could be fixed _post hoc_ with an inverse probability relevance filter, i.e., a process that only accepted a bag-of-features-based match between two items if the features in the intersection of the items' bags also happen to be the highest relevance (~highest inverse-probability) features in their respective bags.\n",

Based on grounds both of implementation ease and theoretical elegance, a decision was finally made not to use the classifier and rely solely on the relevance filter for the time being (where the relevance filter can be seen as an inverted index mapping features to answers containing those features, and their inverse probabilities as a [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf–idf)-like feature weighting).\n",
